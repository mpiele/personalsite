Sulo is a teenager from Finland.

As you can imagine, he was doing usual teenage activities like gaming or playing tennis.

But one day, the real world hit him.

He realized that he needs to do something in his life.

To be useful to society.

As he was still in high school, so he didn’t have a lot of qualifications, his best bet was to work as a waiter at a local pizzeria.

He landed the job.

After his first shift, he decided he would order something from the pizzeria, to see if he likes it or not.

Searched it up on Google, and, to his surprise, the business had no website.

Instead of ditching the idea and moving on, Sulo saw something more there.

He saw opportunity.

His favorite subjects in school were computer science and arts.

What comes out of these two?

You guessed it, website design.

The next day at work, Sulo, with all his courage built up, confronted his boss.

“Hey, I wanted to talk to you about something”, he said.

“Yes Sulo, what is it?”

“I noticed that the pizzeria has no website”

”Yeah, the clients are usually locals and they know all the menu items already”

”But do you know who doesn’t?”

”Who?”

“Tourists. You miss on a lot of tourists who could’ve chosen this place to eat, but they can’t find it online”

”You’re right, I’ll probably hire someone to do it these days”

“You don’t have to, I can do it for you”

“You can try… How much do you want?”

”Nothing, I want to practice my skills”

“Sure man, that sounds great”

”I’ll show it to you next week”

Sulo was in ecstasy.

His first real project, even if he didn’t get paid anything.

He worked day and night to make something great.

Research after research, failure after failure, the final product was finally done.

He showed the website to his boss.

“Man, this is fucking awesome!”, the man said with enthusiasm.

”Thanks a lot”

“Look, I can’t take this without paying you anything, I will wire you €500 tomorrow”

His first freelance money.

Sulo couldn’t have been more happier.

He realized that his skills were a lot more than just being a waiter.

He could actually build something great out of this.

That’s when he thought about going worldwide with his business, not just local restaurants.

He made his first 𝕏 account.

A few months have passed and he was grinding restlessly on his designs.

But he didn’t get any more customers.

He was frustrated, not realizing what was wrong with his strategy.

He then realized than maybe he wasn’t made for social media.

He needed someone else to handle the growth of his account, while he could just totally focus on making the websites.

And that’s where he found me.

We chatted a bit on the app.

And then booked a call:

“I want to grow on X”, he said. “I know that you can help me”

”I can. What’s your niche?”

”Website design”

“And how good are you at it?”

“I’m the best”

And he wasn’t lying.

He has been perfecting his craft for months.

I decided to work with him.

But before that, there was still a missing piece.

I needed to know him and his business.

Better than everyone else.

How else could I write posts exactly in his style?

So after that call, we didn’t become only partners.

But friends.

The program had started.

After one week?

His following doubled.

He had one viral post. 

And the best part?

4 new leads for his business.

In just one week.

Looking back now, I realized what Sulo’s problem was from the beginning and I fixed it.

He tried to do everything himself.

Instead, he should’ve only focused 100% on what he’s best at - website design.

Once he figured that out?

Exponential growth.
